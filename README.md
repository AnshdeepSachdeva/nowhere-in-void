## About the Author
**Greetings, my name is Anshdeep Singh Sachdeva.**

As the developer behind the 3D game "Nowhere In Void", I am a 12th-grade student who has used the 2023 Summer Holidays to delve into the realm of game development and enhance my coding abilities.

This was a wonderful learning opportunity, allowing me to familiarize myself with new techniques and technologies. It was my first experience of conceptualizing and building a game from ground up. It helped me to gain invaluable insights into game development.

Fuelled by a passion for coding, gaming, and technology, this project served as the ideal amalgamation of my interests. What began as a summer project quickly evolved into a labor of love, seeing me dedicate countless hours to the game's design, coding, debugging, and refinement to provide an unparalleled gaming experience.

As a devoted learner and developer, I am always open to feedback and suggestions for improvement. I eagerly anticipate hearing from you and hope you derive as much enjoyment from playing the game as I did from developing it!
