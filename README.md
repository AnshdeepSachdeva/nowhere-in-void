## About the Author
**My name is Anshdeep Singh** and I'm the developer behind this game. I am 12th-grade student. I developed this game during 2023 Summer Holidays to explore game development and further enhance my coding skills.

This was a wonderful learning opportunity for me to familiarize myself with new techniques and technologies. It was my first experience of conceptualizing and building a game from scratch.

I am passionate about coding, gaming, and technology, and this project was the perfect fusion of all three. While it started as a summer project, it quickly became a labor of love. I have put countless hours into designing, coding, debugging, and refining the game to give you the best gaming experience possible.

I am always eager to learn and improve, and I am open to feedback and suggestions. I'm looking forward to hearing from you, and I hope you enjoy playing the game as much as I enjoyed developing it!
